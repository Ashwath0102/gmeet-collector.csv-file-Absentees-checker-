# gmeet-collector.csv-file-Absentees-checker-

This absentees checker is tailored for my 2018â€“2022 CS engineering class registration numbers, and the code selects the downloaded csv file to determine which numbers are absent and displays the results on the interface and on the terminal. Tkinter and openpyxl are used to make this checker operate.
